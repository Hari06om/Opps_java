## 📚 Course Overview

This repository contains comprehensive study materials for Object Oriented Programming concepts. Each topic is organized with theoretical explanations, practical examples, and hands-on exercises to help you master OOP principles.

## 📋 Table of Contents

### 🏗️ **1. Classes & Objects**
- **What it covers**: Foundation of OOP - understanding the blueprint (class) and instances (objects)
- **Key concepts**: Class definition, object creation, attributes, and methods
- **Why it matters**: Forms the basic building blocks of object-oriented design

### 🔒 **2. Access Modifiers**
- **What it covers**: Controlling visibility and accessibility of class members
- **Key concepts**: Public, private, protected, and package-private access levels
- **Why it matters**: Ensures data security and proper encapsulation

### 🎯 **3. Getters & Setters**
- **What it covers**: Controlled access to private class attributes
- **Key concepts**: Property access methods, data validation, and controlled modification
- **Why it matters**: Maintains data integrity while providing necessary access

### 📦 **4. Encapsulation**
- **What it covers**: Bundling data and methods together while hiding internal implementation
- **Key concepts**: Data hiding, abstraction of complexity, interface design
- **Why it matters**: Creates maintainable, secure, and modular code

### 🏗️ **5. Constructors**
- **What it covers**: Special methods for object initialization
- **Key concepts**: Default constructors, parameterized constructors, constructor chaining
- **Why it matters**: Ensures objects are properly initialized with valid states

### 🔧 **6. Types of Constructors**
- **What it covers**: Different constructor variations and their use cases
- **Key concepts**: No-arg constructors, parameterized constructors, copy constructors
- **Why it matters**: Provides flexibility in object creation and initialization

### 📋 **7. Copy Constructor**
- **What it covers**: Creating new objects as copies of existing ones
- **Key concepts**: Shallow vs deep copying, object cloning, memory management
- **Why it matters**: Enables safe object duplication without reference issues

### 🔄 **8. Shallow & Deep Copy**
- **What it covers**: Different approaches to copying objects and their data
- **Key concepts**: Reference copying vs value copying, nested object handling
- **Why it matters**: Prevents unintended data sharing between object copies

### 💥 **9. Destructors**
- **What it covers**: Methods called when objects are destroyed or go out of scope
- **Key concepts**: Resource cleanup, memory management, finalization
- **Why it matters**: Prevents memory leaks and ensures proper resource management

### 🔗 **10. Inheritance**
- **What it covers**: Creating new classes based on existing ones
- **Key concepts**: Parent-child relationships, code reuse, IS-A relationships
- **Why it matters**: Promotes code reusability and establishes hierarchical relationships

### 🎯 **11. Single-level Inheritance**
- **What it covers**: Direct parent-child inheritance relationship
- **Key concepts**: Basic inheritance, method overriding, super keyword
- **Why it matters**: Simplest form of inheritance, foundation for complex hierarchies

### 🔗 **12. Multi-level Inheritance**
- **What it covers**: Chain of inheritance relationships (grandparent-parent-child)
- **Key concepts**: Inheritance chains, method resolution, constructor chaining
- **Why it matters**: Models real-world hierarchical relationships

### 🌳 **13. Hierarchical Inheritance**
- **What it covers**: Multiple child classes inheriting from a single parent
- **Key concepts**: One-to-many inheritance, shared functionality, specialized behavior
- **Why it matters**: Enables code sharing among related but distinct classes

### 🔀 **14. Hybrid Inheritance**
- **What it covers**: Combination of different inheritance types
- **Key concepts**: Complex inheritance patterns, diamond problem, virtual inheritance
- **Why it matters**: Handles complex real-world modeling scenarios

### 🎭 **15. Polymorphism**
- **What it covers**: One interface, multiple implementations
- **Key concepts**: Method overloading, method overriding, dynamic binding
- **Why it matters**: Enables flexible and extensible code design

### 🔄 **16. Method Overloading**
- **What it covers**: Multiple methods with same name but different parameters
- **Key concepts**: Compile-time polymorphism, parameter variations, method signatures
- **Why it matters**: Provides multiple ways to call the same logical operation

### ⬆️ **17. Method Overriding**
- **What it covers**: Redefining parent class methods in child classes
- **Key concepts**: Runtime polymorphism, dynamic method dispatch, @Override annotation
- **Why it matters**: Enables specialized behavior in inherited classes

### 📦 **18. Packages in Java**
- **What it covers**: Organizing related classes and interfaces into namespaces
- **Key concepts**: Package declaration, import statements, package hierarchy
- **Why it matters**: Provides namespace management and access control

### 🎨 **19. Abstraction**
- **What it covers**: Hiding complex implementation details, showing only essential features
- **Key concepts**: Abstract classes, abstract methods, implementation hiding
- **Why it matters**: Simplifies complex systems and focuses on what objects do, not how

### 📝 **20. Abstract Classes**
- **What it covers**: Classes that cannot be instantiated, serve as base classes
- **Key concepts**: Abstract methods, concrete methods, partial implementation
- **Why it matters**: Provides common structure while enforcing specific implementations

### 🔌 **21. Interfaces**
- **What it covers**: Contracts that define what a class must do
- **Key concepts**: Method signatures, multiple inheritance, default methods
- **Why it matters**: Achieves multiple inheritance and defines clear contracts

### 🔑 **22. Static Keyword**
- **What it covers**: Class-level members that belong to the class, not instances
- **Key concepts**: Static variables, static methods, static blocks, memory management
- **Why it matters**: Enables class-level functionality and memory optimization

### 🔒 **23. Super Keyword**
- **What it covers**: Reference to parent class members and constructors
- **Key concepts**: Accessing parent methods, constructor chaining, disambiguation
- **Why it matters**: Enables proper inheritance relationships and method resolution
